## Power Supply
There is a built in dual-rail power supply. It provides Â±15V at 1A (total) on the output which is accessible via two terminal blocks and plenty of pin headers. There is also a 5V supply but this is only for on-board circuitry. The supply is linear, so having the heatsinks is suggested.
